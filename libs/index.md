title: Overview of code libraries
---

The tables linked here list a set of libraries written in Scala for working with citable scholarly resources.  Listings include links to repositories on github source, and to binary releases on bintray.   Binaries are cross-compiled for the JVM (and should be usable from other JVM languages like Java, Kotlin, Groovy or Clojure), and for JavaScript.
